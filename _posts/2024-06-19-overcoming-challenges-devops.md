## Introduction :house:
During a recent migration process, our team faced challenges in protecting microservices and ensuring security compliance while maintaining scalability. In this blog post, I will share some real-life experiences from my role in overcoming these challenges.

### Protecting Microservices :lock:
In the old architecture, microservices were accessible via load balancers in a public subnet which required validation of API calls coming from other entities 🔓. To address this challenge during migration, we decided to protect the microservices by only making AWS API Gateway accessible from the public internet 🌐. The connectivity between API Gateway and backend load balancers and microservices was established through an internal VPC connection 🔗.

### Maintaining Security Compliance Across Infrastructure :lock:
Our organization faced challenges with maintaining security compliance across a large and complex infrastructure that included both on-premises and cloud resources 🏠. To tackle this challenge, we implemented tools like AWS Config or CloudTrail for monitoring configuration changes across all of our AWS resources 👀. Furthermore, we adopted Cloudformation, SSM, and Parameterstore for automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration management to ensure consistency in security policies :wrench:. Additionally, a DevSecOps approach was integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process 🔒.

### Managing Scalability and Performance During Peak Traffic :rocket:
Our organization experienced significant spikes in traffic during certain periods which put a strain on our infrastructure's ability to handle the load and maintain performance levels 📈. To address this challenge, we implemented solutions like Amazon Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) for distributing incoming application traffic across multiple instances :balance_scale:, Auto Scaling groups for automatically scaling resources up or down based on demand ➕➖, and tools like CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms to monitor resource utilization and performance levels in real-time 📊.

### Conclusion :clap:
Throughout my career as a DevOps Engineer, I have encountered various challenges related to managing complexity, ensuring security compliance, and maintaining scalability during peak traffic periods. By implementing innovative solutions like service discovery tools, container orchestration technologies, infrastructure automation tools, and performance monitoring tools, I was able to effectively address these challenges without explicitly using a specific methodology such as the STAR method 💡. Stay tuned for more insights into my experiences in DevOps Engineering!
